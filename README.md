# Glade2Ada
A method of creating a .glade file into a number of packages
This program also needs the files in my other repositries
These are Prrogram_Initiation and Special_Memory_Concepts
The .grp file must be changed. The direcories for Debuggin and 
Strings must be removed. The with Debugging Lines must also be
removed
The program is still under construction and will updated when needed.
If you have ideas for additions and better code please make contact
and if interested you even can co develop. Contact can be made at
